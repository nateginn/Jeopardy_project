# Jeopardy_project
Codecademy This is Jeopardy! project using Pandas and some numpy
This project contains a jeopardy.csv file which was provided as a data source.
The project was to data mine for specific key words, ie 'King' 'England'.
the jeopardy.py is the provided example code from Codecademy. I did not write this.
I felt like it was limiting and wanted some user input, so I expanded the project and added user input to select the search terms. I also expanded the results provided. 
download the 2 .py files and the .csv file to compare what the project asked for and the additional features I added on my own. I could have expanded further, but I wanted to work on the quiz.
the jeopardy_quiz.py file uses the same jeopardy.csv file to create a quiz that allows the user to select categories and values and then answer questions. It keeps score as you go along. 
Again, this quiz could have been expanded, but I needed to keep progressing in the course. 
Download the jeopardy_quiz.py to test the program and your knowledge.
